# ML Starters

## Machine Learning:
ML is about using examples to develop an <i>expert system</i> that can make useful statements about new inputs.

### Types of Learning:
<ol>
	<li><b>Supervised Learning</b>: Examples: <i>Classification</i>(to predict what class an instance of data should fall into), <i>Regression</i>(prediction of a numeric value)</li>
	<li><b>Unsupervised Learning</b>: Examples: <i>Clustering(grouping of similar items together)</i>, <i>Density Estimation</i>(finding statistical values which describe the data.)</li>
</ol>

#### Training Set, Training Examples, Features/Attributes, Target Variable, Classes: 
The complete data set used to train an algorithm is named as <i>Training Set</i>.<br />
One Training Set has several <i>Training Examples</i>.<br />
One Training Example is constructed using several <i>Features/Attributes</i> and <i>Target Variable</i>.<br />
<i>Features/Attributes</i> are the given values for which ML algorithm tries to predict what <i>Target Variable</i> should be for a <i>Training Example</i>.<br />
In the Classification Problem the <i>Target Variables</i> are called <i>Classes</i> and there is assumed to be a finite number of <i>classes</i>.<br />
